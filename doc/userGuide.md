# Running AdoptOpenJDK Tests

If you have immediate test-related questions, please post them to the [AdoptOpenJDK testing Slack channel](https://adoptopenjdk.slack.com/messages/C5219G28G).

Platform: x64_linux | x64_mac | s390x_linux | ppc64le_linux | aarch64_linux

Java Version: SE80 | SE90 | SE100

Set up your test machine with this [set of prerequisites](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/test/docs/Prerequisites.md).

## Jenkins setup and running
While you can [run all the tests manually](#local-testing-via-make-targets-on-the-commandline) via the make targets on the command line, you may also run the tests in Jenkins. As part of the AdoptOpenJDK continuous integration (CI), AdoptOpenJDK runs test builds against the release and nightly SDK builds.

You can set up your own Jenkins-based test builds using the AdoptOpenJDK openjdk-tests Jenkinsfiles by:
	
- Configure a [Jenkins job with a Customized URL](#jenkins-configuration-with-customized-url)
- Ensure your Jenkins machines are configured properly (see the [openjdk-infrastructure playbooks](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure/blob/master/ansible/README.md) for details)
- Ensure machines are labeled following the [AdoptOpenJDK labeling scheme](https://github.com/smlambert/openjdk-infrastructure/blob/labels/docs/jenkinslabels.md).  Minimally, your Jenkins nodes should have hw.arch.xxxx and sw.os.xxxx labels (for example, hw.arch.x86 and sw.os.linux for an x86_linux machine).

### Jenkins Configuration with Customized URL

1. Create Pipeline test build job using Pipeline script from SCM  
- Repository url - :https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests.git
- Branches to build - */master
- Script path - buildenv/jenkins/fileToMatchVersionAndPlatformToTest, example openjdk8_x86-64_linux
![pipeline from SCM](/doc/diagrams/pipelineFromSCM.jpg)

2. Create necessary parameters

* TARGET - relates to the test target you wish to run (system, openjdk, perf, external, jck, functional are the top-level targets, but you can also add any of the sub-targets, including those defined in playlist.xml files in test directories)
* JVM_VERSION - depending on what SDK you are testing against (some possible values are: openjdk8, openjdk8-openj9, openjdk9, openjdk9-openj9, openjdk10, openjdk10-openj9, openjdk10-sap)
* CUSTOMIZED_SDK_URL - the URL for where to pick up the SDK to test (if you are picking up builds from AdoptOpenJDK, please refer to the [openjdk-api README](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-api/blob/master/README.md) for more details)

## Local testing via make targets on the commandline

#### Clone the repo and pick up the dependencies
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests.git
cd openjdk-tests
get.sh -t openjdk-testsDIR -p platform [-j SE80] [-i hotspot] [-R latest] [-T jdk] [-s downloadBinarySDKDIR] [-r SDK_RESOURCE] [-c CUSTOMIZED_SDK_URL]
```

Where possible values of get.sh script are:
```
Usage : get.sh  --testdir|-t openjdktestdir
                --platform|-p x64_linux | x64_mac | s390x_linux | ppc64le_linux | aarch64_linux | ppc64_aix

                [--jdk_version|-j ] : optional. JDK version

                [--jdk_impl|-i ] : optional. JDK implementation

                [--releases|-R ] : optional. Example: latest, jdk8u172-b00-201807161800

                [--type|-T ] : optional. jdk or jre

                [--sdkdir|-s binarySDKDIR] : if do not have a local sdk available, specify preferred directory

                [--sdk_resource|-r ] : indicate where to get sdk - releases, nightly , upstream or customized

                [--customizedURL|-c ] : indicate sdk url if sdk source is set as customized
                [--openj9_repo ] : optional. OpenJ9 git repo. Default value: https://github.com/eclipse/openj9.git is used if not provided
                [--openj9_sha ] : optional. OpenJ9 pull request sha.
                [--openj9_branch ] : optional. OpenJ9 branch.
                [--vendor_repos ] : optional. Comma separated Git repository URLs of the vendor repositories
                [--vendor_shas ] : optional. Comma separated SHAs of the vendor repositories
                [--vendor_branches ] : optional. Comma separated vendor branches
                [--vendor_dirs ] : optional. Comma separated directories storing vendor test resources
```

#### Set environment variables, configure, build and run tests

You can use the same approach as described in the [OpenJ9 functional tests README file]( https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/test/README.md).  In the case of the tests run at AdoptOpenJDK, instead of using a make target called _sanity.functional, you can provide the appropriate make target to run the tests of interest to you. 

##### Top-level test targets:
- openjdk 
- system
- external
- perf
- jck

##### Sub-targets by level:
- _sanity.openjdk, _sanity.system, _sanity.external, _sanity.perf, etc.
- _extended.openjdk, _extended.system, _extended.external, _extended.perf, etc.

##### Sub-targets by directory:
Refer to these instructions for how to [run tests by directory](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/test/README.md#5-how-to-execute-a-directory-of-tests)

##### Sub-targets by test name:
In each playlist.xml file in each test directory, there are tests defined.  Test targets are generated from the ```<testCaseName>``` tag, so you can use the test case name as a make target.

For example, for this excerpt from a playlist:
```
<test>
		<testCaseName>scala_test</testCaseName> 
		...
```
you will be able to run 'make scala_test' to execute the test.

### Examples

#### Sanity check an upstream JDK 8u patch

Consider you are an upstream OpenJDK developer on Linux x86_64, and you'd like to run OpenJDK sanity tests locally on a patch for OpenJDK 8. Let the OpenJDK checkout be at `openjdk-jdk8u`, you've produced
a *fastdebug* build and would like to run the regression test suite, `_sanity.openjdk` on it.

```
$ OPENJDK_SOURCES="$(pwd)/openjdk-jdk8u"
$ OPENJDK_BUILD=$OPENJDK_SOURCES/build/linux-x86_64-normal-server-fastdebug/images/j2sdk-image
$ tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)
$ pushd $tmpdir
$ git clone https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests
$ cd openjdk-tests
$ TOP_DIR=$(pwd)
$ TEST_DIR="$TOP_DIR"
$ pushd openjdk
$ ln -s $OPENJDK_SOURCES openjdk-jdk
$ popd
$ export BUILD_LIST=openjdk
$ export BUILD_ROOT=$TOP_DIR/test-results
$ export JRE_IMAGE=$OPENJDK_BUILD/../j2re-image
$ export TEST_JDK_HOME=$OPENJDK_BUILD
$ ./get.sh -t $TEST_DIR
$ ./maketest.sh $TEST_DIR
$ OPENJDK_DIR=$OPENJDK_SOURCES ./maketest.sh $TEST_DIR _sanity.openjdk
$ popd
$ echo "openjdk-tests located at $tmpdir/openjdk-tests"

```

If all goes well, this should run sanity JTREG OpenJDK tests on your hotspot JDK 8 build and all of them should be passing. Output will then look like this:

```
[...]

```

The JTREG report HTML summary file is then located at `openjdk-tests/test-results/openjdk/report/html/index.html`




Environment Variable Guide – Jenkins

This is the guide on how to pass in environment variables when making builds with Jenkins. For the directions on this, we will be using the example variable below:
TR_Options='verbose,vlog=testExample1.log'
There are two ways to do this, and there will be screenshot demonstrations for each step. 



Method 1: Write it in as part of the playlist file


1.	Find the folder that your test is in
 
2.	Open the playlist.xml file
 
3.	Find the <testCaseName> matching with the test you want to run
 
4.	In the corresponding <command> section, at the beginning, add the key word `export`, your environment variable, followed by a semicolon
 
5.	Save it, git add, commit, push
 
6.	Go to the Jenkins page, and open up the Grinders
 
7.	Click “Build with Parameters” on the left side of the page, third down from the top
8.	In the ADOPTOPENJDK_REPO section, put in the repository you were working from when you made those changes
 
9.	In the ADOPTOPENJDK_BRANCH section, put in the branch you were on
 
10.	In the BUILD_LIST and TARGET sections, put in the corresponding information
 
11.	Scroll to the bottom and hit the Build button
 


Method 2: Put it in the systemtest.mk file


1.	Open the openjdk-tests/system folder
 
2.	Open the systemtest.mk file
 
3.	Find the last line of the file, the line that says SYSTEMTEST_RESROOT=$(TEST_RESROOT)/../
 
4.	Insert the key word `export`, followed by your environment variable, without any single or double quotation marks, in the line above it
 
5.	Save it, git add, commit, push
 
6.	Go to the Jenkins page, and open up the Grinders
 
7.	Click “Build with Parameters” on the left side of the page, third down from the top
8.	In the ADOPTOPENJDK_REPO section, put in the repository you were working from when you made those changes
 
9.	In the ADOPTOPENJDK_BRANCH section, put in the branch you were on
 
10.	In the BUILD_LIST and TARGET sections, put in the corresponding information
 
11.	Scroll to the bottom and hit the Build button
